# installed-programs

Detect installed programs and save to csv. Optionally only save programs not in an existing csv file.

This was just written to run a few times, in order to compare installed software between my computers, so is not particularly well tested. 

Only works on windows.

## Usage
`installed-programs.py <output> [--compare-to=<input>]`
